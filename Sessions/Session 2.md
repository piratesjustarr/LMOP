- Delivered the wagon to Elmar Barthen at Barthen's Provisions.
- Spent the night at the Stonehill Inn getting tanked, with the encouragement of the proprietor Toblin Stonehill.

#### Spellforge Ballad

In a time of old, when legends were told,
A tale of dwarves and gnomes, oh so bold.
Phandelver's Pact, a bond to be kept,
Sharing a mine, where treasures were kept.
Wave Echo Cave, a wondrous sight,
With minerals gleaming, shining so bright.
A forge of magic, where power was brewed,
Crafting wonders, whispers ensued.
Human spellcasters, joined the alliance,
With dwarves and gnomes, a fearsome reliance.
Together they channeled the cave's mystic might,
Into the Forge of Spells, casting wonderous light.
Phandalin thrived, from the riches it gained,
Prospering alongside, as magic remained.
But fate had a hand, disaster did strike,
As orcs laid waste, bringing endless plight.
Evil mercenaries, with dark intentions clear,
Joined the orc horde, causing mortal fear.
They sought the cave, its treasures and lore,
To claim its power, forevermore.
Battle ensued, with spells and swords clashing,
The very cavern trembled, its pillars crashing.
Wave Echo Cave crumbled, consumed by the fight,
Leaving destruction, in its wake, day and night.
Survivors were few, as hope slipped away.
