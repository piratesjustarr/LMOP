## How to play
- LotR, Monty Python, GoT
- Boundaries (gore, fun level, snakes/spiders phobias)
- Player connections
- Backstories (link to NPCs, rumours, items (letter of introduction))
- Trinkets

- LOVEBOMB GUNDRUN

Gundrun
- Start in the Tavern with Gundrun and Sildar
- Yukon Cornelius
- Paying for drinks and meal
- Super excited, wants to get rich

Sildar
- Check on Iarno

- G+S leave at the crack of dawn
- Party follows on once the wagons are all set and ready to go, about half a day behind (but slower as not horseback)
- South on the Highrouad for a few days, camping out under the stars
- Turn east onto the Triboar Trail, much rougher
- Dead horses.

(Carry on or not?)
