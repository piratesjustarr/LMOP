- LOVEBOMB GUNDRUN

"The warm and welcome hubbub of early evening washes over you as you step into the Driftwood Tavern in Neverwinter. A fine establishment that caters to a richer clientele than that you are used to.

The inside is decorated with curios, salvage, and relics from across Neverwinter from before its devastation. 

As you look around the common room you hear the voice your old acquaintance Gundrun Rockseeker calling you over.

"Hey lads, over here!"

At the back of the room you see Gundren waving, you over. And next to him a tall man you  aren't familiar with.

"Sit down lads, sit down. " 

He leans forwards conspiratorially. "Fortune and glory, lads."






An old statue from a beloved fountain stood in the corners, the planter boxes of a Neverwintan wineseller were mounted on the walls and filled with flowers, ornate doors taken from the rubble doubled as fine tables, the privy door sported the doorknob and knocker from a noble's house, and unbroken panes of stained glass were hung from the ceiling and loaded with hundreds of  candles for use as chandeliers. It all appeared tasteful rather than tacky.

long-term patrons, citizens, and friends

Both Neverwintan and Waterdhavian nobless, including Margasters could be seen in its common room.
